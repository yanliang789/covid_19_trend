# CS633 Covid-19 Trend Predictor

### Project Description

<ul>
    <li>Build machine-learning models which can predict the trend of covid afterwards.</li>
    <li>Cover world-wide countries and regions.</li>
    <li>Train the models to consider influence from widespread application of vaccine.</li>
 </ul>

### Data

- Data source: Kaggle
- Date Range: start date: 2020-01-22, end date 2020-05-02
